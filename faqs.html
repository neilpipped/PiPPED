                    <p>During the early stages of your business, you may not feel the need for a digital footprint. However, as you scale up, you may feel your competitors take up market share, 
                        so it is imperative that your customers know who you are, from at least a static website (like this!) and LinkedIn profile with basic contact info.

                    <p>Absolutely. With the invention of laptop computers, remote work and partnerships have actually been possible for at least the last two decades. It took a global pandemic in
                        2019 for most people to realise this but you don't actually need to meet in-person to do business. With a combination of resources such as teleconferencing, e-mail and the
                        traditional telephone, communication is as easy as ever whether you're in the same city or on the other side of the world.
